## What I learned

I recreated this website to learn and experience using CSS.

I was able to understand how to implement styles and design into a website using CSS. 

## Overview of tools used from CSS

* Add colors, font-size, text-align, text-shadow, line-height, font-family, and so forth... to text

* Add background color, linear gradients, and borders.

* Different display styles, i.e. block, inline, inline-block

* Spacing and placement of elements

* Specificity in CSS 

* Creating rows and columns in CSS

* inline/internal/external CSS

* Creating Mobile compatibile Elements
